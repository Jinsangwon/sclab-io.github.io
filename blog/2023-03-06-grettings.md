Hello,

SCLAB Studio is an editor that allows you to visualize data without coding and a tool to create various dashboards without coding.

You can easily connect to various data sources such as CSV, API, IoT, Kafka, and Databases, and anyone can access the created dashboards as a web service.

In the future, we will introduce various articles such as news and guides about Scrap here.

Thank you.
