Data visualization is a very effective tool to help you understand and analyze your data more efficiently. But just because you have data doesn’t mean you can blindly visualize it.

The data must be refined to some extent for data visualization. The data must be free from errors such as missing values or outliers. Otherwise, visualization results may convey misleading information.

In addition, specific knowledge and skills were required depending on the type of data visualization produced. For example, drawing a bar graph is relatively simple, but map visualization requires geographic information (GIS) and cartography skills.

Visualization cannot be done with only data. To visualize data, it is necessary to understand and analyze the data well before selecting and using appropriate visualization methods and tools. Therefore, understanding and analysis of data, as well as knowledge and skills for visualization, are all required to visualize data.
