![Create a web map](./48.png)
- Add a web map in the map editor, edit the title, and click the edit button on the right. The map menu list described above appears.
- Click the map item and select the map with the desired background. Because it is Chicago Fire station information, enlarge the map so that Chicago city can be seen larger, and then save the current location.
- Select the data to be applied to the map from the location menu and deactivate the eye shape for the rest of the locations. Go back to the map menu and save the current location.
- If you go back to the map editor and check it, you can see that it was applied as the last saved image.
